## 6. **Bypass of System Access Controls**

### **Common Methods Used to Bypass AD Controls**

1. **Pass-the-Hash (PtH) Attacks**:

   - **Description**: Attackers capture and reuse hashed credentials to authenticate without needing to decrypt them.
   - **Mechanism**: By capturing hashed credentials from memory or network traffic, attackers can authenticate to other systems.
   - **Example**: Using tools like Mimikatz to extract hashed passwords and then utilizing them to access other systems.

3. **Pass-the-Ticket (PtT) Attacks**:

   - **Description**: Attackers use stolen Kerberos tickets to impersonate users.
   - **Mechanism**: Capturing Kerberos tickets (TGT or service tickets) from memory and reusing them to access resources.
   - **Example**: Leveraging tools like Rubeus to harvest Kerberos tickets and perform lateral movement.

5. **Golden Ticket Attacks**:

   - **Description**: Creating a forged Kerberos ticket granting ticket (TGT) using the KRBTGT account hash.
   - **Mechanism**: Once an attacker has the KRBTGT hash, they can create a TGT that grants domain admin privileges.
   - **Example**: Using Mimikatz to generate a golden ticket and gain access to any resource in the domain.

7. **Silver Ticket Attacks**:

   - **Description**: Creating a forged Kerberos service ticket (TGS) for a specific service.
   - **Mechanism**: By compromising a service account’s hash, attackers can create service tickets to access specific services.
   - **Example**: Using the service account hash with Mimikatz to generate a silver ticket.

9. **DCShadow Attacks**:

   - **Description**: Registering a rogue Domain Controller and using it to push malicious changes to the AD.
   - **Mechanism**: By registering a fake DC, attackers can replicate changes to the AD schema or configuration.
   - **Example**: Using Mimikatz’s DCShadow feature to add backdoor accounts or change security settings.

11. **Credential Dumping**:

   - **Description**: Extracting plaintext passwords, hashes, or Kerberos tickets from memory.
   - **Mechanism**: Tools like Mimikatz can be used to dump credentials from LSASS memory.
   - **Example**: Using Mimikatz to dump credentials and then using those credentials for further attacks.

13. **Exploiting Misconfigurations**:

   - **Description**: Taking advantage of misconfigurations such as weak ACLs, improper delegation, or overly permissive group memberships.
   - **Mechanism**: By exploiting these weaknesses, attackers can escalate privileges or move laterally within the network.
   - **Example**: Abusing writable DACLs to add users to the Domain Admins group.

### Security Measures to Reinforce Access Controls

1. **Implement Least Privilege**:

   - **Description**: Ensure users and service accounts have only the necessary permissions.
   - **Implementation**: Regularly review and audit permissions to minimize excessive privileges.
   - **Example**: Remove users from the Domain Admins group if they do not need administrative access.
  
  - **Get-ADGroupMember**: Lists members of a specific AD group.
  ```powershell
  Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" | Select-Object Name, SamAccountName
  ```
  - **Get-ADUser**: Retrieves details about a specific user.
  ```powershell
  Get-ADUser -Identity "username" -Properties * | Select-Object Name, Enabled, LastLogonDate, PasswordLastSet
  ```


2. **Use Strong Authentication Methods**:

   - **Description**: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users, especially privileged accounts.
   - **Implementation**: Use hardware tokens, biometric factors, or mobile app-based MFA.
   - **Example**: Enforcing MFA for remote access and administrative tasks.

3. **Regularly Update and Patch Systems**:

   - **Description**: Keep all systems, especially domain controllers, updated with the latest security patches.
   - **Implementation**: Automate patch management processes to ensure timely updates.
   - **Example**: Using WSUS or a third-party patch management solution to deploy patches.

4. **Monitor and Audit**:

   - **Description**: Continuously monitor for suspicious activities and maintain detailed logs.
   - **Implementation**: Use SIEM solutions to aggregate and analyze logs from AD and other systems.
   - **Example**: Setting up alerts for unusual login times or locations for privileged accounts.

5. **Restrict Credential Use**:

   - **Description**: Limit the use of privileged credentials to specific systems and sessions.
   - **Implementation**: Implement credential guard and restrict where admin accounts can log in.
   - **Example**: Using Windows Defender Credential Guard to protect LSASS from credential dumping.

6. **Implement Network Segmentation**:

   - **Description**: Isolate critical systems and sensitive data from the rest of the network.
   - **Implementation**: Use VLANs, firewalls, and access controls to enforce segmentation.
   - **Example**: Separating domain controllers from user workstations using network segmentation.

7. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing**:

   - **Description**: Conduct regular security assessments to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
   - **Implementation**: Engage third-party security firms for thorough penetration testing.
   - **Example**: Performing annual penetration tests to identify weaknesses in AD security.

8. **Deploy Endpoint Protection**:

   - **Description**: Use advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to protect against malware and credential theft.
   - **Implementation**: Deploy EDR tools across all endpoints and continuously monitor for threats.
   - **Example**: Using solutions like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to detect and respond to malicious activities.

- Test for common bypass methods.

```powershell
# Attempt to add a user to an AD group without proper permissions

Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Members "MaliciousUser" -WhatIf
```

#### **Security Measures to Reinforce Access Controls**

- Review access control configurations.

```powershell
# Check ACLs for critical AD objects

Get-Acl "AD:\CN=AdminSDHolder,CN=System,DC=domain,DC=com"
```
