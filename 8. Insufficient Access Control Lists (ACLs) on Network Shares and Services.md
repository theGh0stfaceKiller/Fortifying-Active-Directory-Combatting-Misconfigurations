## 8. **Insufficient Access Control Lists (ACLs) on Network Shares and Services**

### **ACLs in AD**

- **Definition and Role**:
  - **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: ACLs are a set of rules that determine which users or system processes are granted access to objects, such as files, directories, and network shares. Each object has an associated ACL that specifies permissions.
  - **Components**: ACLs consist of Access Control Entries (ACEs), where each ACE specifies a user or group and the level of access granted (e.g., read, write, execute).
  
- **Function in AD**:
  - **Security**: ACLs help secure resources by ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive data and services.
  - **Granularity**: Allows fine-grained control over permissions, enabling precise specification of who can access what and how.

### Best Practices for Configuring ACLs

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**:
   - **Description**: Assign the minimum level of access required for users to perform their job functions.
   - **Implementation**: Regularly review permissions to ensure users do not have excessive privileges. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to simplify management.

2. **Inheritance Management**:
   - **Inheritance**: Ensure proper inheritance of permissions from parent objects to child objects to maintain consistency.
   - **Implementation**: Check that permissions are inherited appropriately and override only when necessary for security reasons.

3. **Regular Audits and Reviews**:
   - **Periodic Reviews**: Conduct regular audits of ACLs to identify and rectify misconfigurations.
   - **Automation**: Use tools to automate the auditing process and generate reports on permissions and access control settings.
- Ensure ACL compliance.

```powershell
# Validate that ACLs meet security policies

Get-Acl -Path "C:\Path\To\SharedFolder" | Format-List
```

4. **Use of Groups for Permissions**:
   - **Group-based Permissions**: Assign permissions to groups rather than individual users to simplify management and improve scalability.
   - **Management**: Maintain well-organized and documented groups to ensure clarity in permissions assignment.
- List ACLs on network shares.

```powershell
# Get ACLs for shared folders

Get-SmbShare | ForEach-Object { Get-Acl $_.Path }
```


5. **Documentation and Change Control**:
   - **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation of ACL configurations and changes.
   - **Change Control**: Implement a change control process to track and approve modifications to ACLs, ensuring they align with security policies.

6. **Segregation of Duties**:
   - **Segregation**: Separate administrative duties among different individuals or teams to reduce the risk of abuse of privileges.
   - **Implementation**: Use multiple levels of approval for critical changes to ACLs and other security settings.
