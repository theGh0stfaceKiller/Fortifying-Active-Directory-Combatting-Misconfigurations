## 3. **Insufficient Internal Network Monitoring**

### **Importance of Monitoring in AD Environments**

- **Security and Compliance**:

  - **Detecting Threats**: Monitoring helps in the early detection of unauthorized access, malicious activities, and potential breaches, enabling timely responses to threats.
	
  - **Compliance**: Regulatory standards and frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) often mandate regular monitoring and logging of network activities to ensure data protection and security.

- **Operational Insight**:

  - **Performance Management**: Monitoring provides insights into the performance and health of AD services, ensuring they run smoothly and efficiently.
	
  - **Incident Response**: Comprehensive monitoring data supports effective incident response and forensic investigations.

### **Tools and Techniques for Effective AD Monitoring**


1. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems**:

   - **Centralized Logging**: SIEM systems collect and correlate logs from various sources, providing a holistic view of the network.

   - **Real-Time Alerts**: They generate real-time alerts for suspicious activities based on predefined rules and anomaly detection.

   -  **Popular SIEM Solutions**:
	   - Splunk
	   - Microsoft Sentinel
	   - IBM QRadar
	   - LogRhythm

2. **AD Specific Monitoring Tools**:

   - **Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA)**: Detects suspicious activities using built-in intelligence and behavioral analytics.

   - **Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)**: Monitors AD activities and alerts on advanced threats and compromised identities.

   - **LepideAuditor**: Provides comprehensive auditing and monitoring of AD changes, user activities, and policy modifications.

3. **Network Traffic Analysis**:

   - **NetFlow and sFlow**: Collect flow data to analyze traffic patterns and detect anomalies.

   - **Zeek (formerly Bro)**: An open-source network monitoring framework for network traffic analysis and threat detection.

4. **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**:

   - **CrowdStrike Falcon**: Provides endpoint monitoring, threat detection, and response capabilities.

   - **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**: Monitors endpoints and integrates with Azure ATP for comprehensive threat detection.

5. **Event Log Monitoring**:

   - **Windows Event Forwarding (WEF)**: Configures Windows systems to forward event logs to a centralized server for monitoring.

   - **PowerShell Scripts**: Custom scripts to automate log collection and analysis for specific AD events.

### **Identifying Indicators of Compromise (IoC) Through Monitoring**

1. **Unusual Logon Activity**:

   - **Multiple Failed Logon Attempts**: Indicates possible brute force attacks.

   - **Logons During Non-Business Hours**: Suspicious logon activities outside normal working hours.

   - **Event IDs to Monitor**:
   
	   - `4625`: Account failed to log on.
	   - `4648`: A logon was attempted using explicit credentials.
	   - `4675`: SIDs were filtered.

2. **Changes to Critical AD Groups**:

   - **Addition of Accounts to High-Privilege Groups**: Unauthorized addition of users to groups like Domain Admins.
   
   - **Event IDs to Monitor**:
   
	   - `4728`: A member was added to a security-enabled global group.
	   - `4732`: A member was added to a security-enabled local group.
	   - `4756`: A member was added to a security-enabled universal group.

3. **Suspicious Process Activity**:

   - **Execution of Unusual or Known Malicious Processes**: Processes that are uncommon or identified as malware.

   - **Tools for Process Monitoring**:
	   - Sysmon: Monitors and logs system activity to the Windows event log.
   
   - **Event IDs to Monitor**:
	   - Sysmon Event ID 1: Process creation.
	   - Sysmon Event ID 3: Network connection detected.


4. **Network Anomalies**:

   - **Unusual Traffic Patterns**: Sudden spikes in traffic, connections to known malicious IP addresses, or abnormal port usage.
   
   - **Tools for Network Monitoring**:
	   - Zeek, Wireshark, and network-based SIEM integrations.

5. **Changes in Security Settings and Policies**:
   - **Modification of Audit Policies or Security Settings**: Changes that could indicate an attacker attempting to cover their tracks.
   
   - **Event IDs to Monitor**:
	   - `4719`: System audit policy was changed.
	   - `4670`: Permissions on an object were changed.
       
    
	```powershell
	# Analyze Security Event Logs for suspicious activities
		 
	Get-WinEvent -LogName Security | Where-Object { $_.Id -in 4719, 4670, 4625, 4769, 4771 }
	```
