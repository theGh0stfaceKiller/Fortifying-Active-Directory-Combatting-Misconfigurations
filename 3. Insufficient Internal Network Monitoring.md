### 3. **Insufficient Internal Network Monitoring**

#### **Importance of Monitoring in AD Environments**

**Security and Compliance**:

**Detecting Threats**: Monitoring helps in the early detection of unauthorized access, malicious activities, and potential breaches, enabling timely responses to threats.

**Compliance**: Regulatory standards and frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) often mandate regular monitoring and logging of network activities to ensure data protection and security.

**Operational Insight**:

**Performance Management**: Monitoring provides insights into the performance and health of AD services, ensuring they run smoothly and efficiently.

**Incident Response**: Comprehensive monitoring data supports effective incident response and forensic investigations.

- Check current monitoring configurations.

	```powershell
	# Ensure that auditing policies are enabled
 
	Get-ADObject -Filter {ObjectClass -eq "AuditPolicy"}
	```

#### **Tools and Techniques for Effective AD Monitoring**

- Implement and test monitoring tools.

	```bash
	# Use Sysmon for detailed monitoring
 
	sysmon -accepteula -i sysmonconfig.xml

	# Configure Windows Event Forwarding
 
	wefutil.exe ss /c:source-computer /n:collector-computer
	```

#### **Identifying Signs of Compromise Through Monitoring**

- Review logs for anomalies.

	```powershell
	# Analyze Security Event Logs for suspicious activities
 
	Get-WinEvent -LogName Security | Where-Object { $_.Id -in 4625, 4769, 4771 }
	```
