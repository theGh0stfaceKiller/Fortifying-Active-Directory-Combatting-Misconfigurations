## 1. **Default Configurations of Software and Applications**

### **Default Configurations in AD Environments**

---
Default configurations of software and applications in Active Directory (AD) environments often include settings that prioritize ease of use and broad compatibility over security. These default settings can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly managed. 

### **Risks Associated with Default Settings**

1. **Risks Associated with Default Credentials**
	- **Unauthorized Access**: Default credentials are widely known and can be easily exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to network devices.
	- **Lateral Movement**: Once an attacker gains access to a network device using default credentials, they can potentially move laterally within the network, compromising additional systems and data.
	- **Data Exfiltration**: Compromised network devices can be used to intercept and exfiltrate sensitive data.
	- **Network Disruption**: Attackers can disrupt network services by reconfiguring or disabling network devices.

2. **Misconfigured ADCS**:
   - **Risk of unauthorized certificate issuance**: Poorly configured certificate templates can allow unauthorized users to issue certificates, leading to identity spoofing.
   - **Weak cryptographic algorithms**: Using outdated or weak cryptographic algorithms can compromise the integrity and confidentiality of certificates.
   - **Improper certificate revocation settings**: Failing to configure proper certificate revocation can allow the use of compromised or outdated certificates.

3. **Legacy Protocols/Services**:
   - **NTLM**: Continued use of NTLM instead of Kerberos can expose the environment to credential relay attacks and pass-the-hash attacks.
   - **LM Hashes**: Storing and allowing LM hashes can lead to easily cracked passwords due to their weak encryption.

4. **Insecure SMB Services**:
   - **SMBv1**: Enabling SMBv1, which is outdated and insecure, exposes the environment to numerous vulnerabilities, such as the EternalBlue exploit used in the WannaCry ransomware attack.
   - **Open SMB Shares**: Misconfigured SMB shares can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.

### **Best Practices for Initial AD Setup and Configuration**

1. **ADCS Configuration**:
   - **Use strong cryptographic algorithms**: Configure ADCS to use strong encryption algorithms like SHA-256 or better. Avoid MD5 and SHA-1.
   - **Define strict certificate templates**: Limit enrollment permissions to specific security groups. Avoid allowing Domain Users to enroll for high-privilege certificates.
   - **Implement certificate revocation**: Use Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) to ensure timely revocation of compromised certificates.
   - **Secure CA servers**: Place Certificate Authorities (CAs) on dedicated, isolated servers. Limit physical and network access to these servers.

2. **Disable Legacy Protocols/Services**:
   - **Disable NTLM where possible**: Use Kerberos for authentication to take advantage of its stronger security features. Configure Group Policy to deny NTLM traffic where possible.
   - **Remove LM Hashes**: Ensure that LM hashes are not stored in the AD database by setting `NoLMHash` in the Group Policy.
   - **Audit and disable unused services**: Regularly audit services and protocols in use, and disable any that are not necessary.

3. **Secure SMB Configuration**:
   - **Disable SMBv1**: Ensure that SMBv1 is disabled on all servers and clients. Use SMBv2 or SMBv3 instead.
   - **Harden SMB shares**: Configure access controls on SMB shares to limit access to authorized users only. Use NTFS permissions to further restrict access.
   - **Enable SMB signing**: Require SMB signing to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

4.  **Use [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/?view=windowsserver2019-ps) periodically audit to ensure secure baseline configurations**:

	```powershell
	# Ensure the AD domain is configured with secure settings
 
	(Get-ADDomain).DomainMode -ge 'Windows2008Domain'
 
	(Get-ADDomain).ForestMode -ge 'Windows2008Forest'
	```


     - List default configuration settings in AD.

	```powershell
	# Check default AD configuration settings
 
	Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy
 
	Get-ADDomainController -Filter * | Select-Object Name, DefaultPartition
	```



      - Identify systems using default configurations.

	```powershell
	# Check if AD domain controllers use default settings
 
	Get-ADDomainController -Filter * | ForEach-Object {Get-ADDomainControllerSettings -Identity $_.Name}
	```
