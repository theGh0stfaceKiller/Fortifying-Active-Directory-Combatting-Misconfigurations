## 1. **Default Configurations of Software and Applications**

### **Default Configurations in AD Environments**

1. **Risks Associated with Default Credentials**
	- **Unauthorized Access**: Default credentials are widely known and can be easily exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to network devices.
	- **Lateral Movement**: Once an attacker gains access to a network device using default credentials, they can potentially move laterally within the network, compromising additional systems and data.
	- **Data Exfiltration**: Compromised network devices can be used to intercept and exfiltrate sensitive data.
	- **Network Disruption**: Attackers can disrupt network services by reconfiguring or disabling network devices.

2. **Misconfigured ADCS**:
   - **Risk of unauthorized certificate issuance**: Poorly configured certificate templates can allow unauthorized users to issue certificates, leading to identity spoofing.
   - **Weak cryptographic algorithms**: Using outdated or weak cryptographic algorithms can compromise the integrity and confidentiality of certificates.
   - **Improper certificate revocation settings**: Failing to configure proper certificate revocation can allow the use of compromised or outdated certificates.

3. **Legacy Protocols/Services**:
   - **NTLM**: Continued use of NTLM instead of Kerberos can expose the environment to credential relay attacks and pass-the-hash attacks.
   - **LM Hashes**: Storing and allowing LM hashes can lead to easily cracked passwords due to their weak encryption.

4. **Insecure SMB Services**:
   - **SMBv1**: Enabling SMBv1, which is outdated and insecure, exposes the environment to numerous vulnerabilities, such as the EternalBlue exploit used in the WannaCry ransomware attack.
   - **Open SMB Shares**: Misconfigured SMB shares can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.

- Use [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/?view=windowsserver2019-ps) to list default configuration settings in AD.

	```powershell
	# Check default AD configuration settings
 
	Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy
 
	Get-ADDomainController -Filter * | Select-Object Name, DefaultPartition
	```

### **Risks Associated with Default Settings**

- Identify systems using default configurations.

	```powershell
	# Check if AD domain controllers use default settings
 
	Get-ADDomainController -Filter * | ForEach-Object {Get-ADDomainControllerSettings -Identity $_.Name}
	```

### **Best Practices for Initial AD Setup and Configuration**

- Ensure secure baseline configurations.

	```powershell
	# Ensure the AD domain is configured with secure settings
 
	(Get-ADDomain).DomainMode -ge 'Windows2008Domain'
 
	(Get-ADDomain).ForestMode -ge 'Windows2008Forest'
	```
