### 2. **Improper Separation of User/Administrator Privileges**

#### **Principle of Least Privilege in AD**

- The  **principle of least privilege (PoLP)** dictates that users and systems should be granted the minimum levels of access—or permissions—necessary to perform their job functions. In an AD environment, this means carefully managing and restricting administrative privileges to reduce the attack surface and limit the potential impact of compromised accounts.

- List users with admin privileges.

	```powershell
	# Identify users in privileged AD groups
 
	Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins"
 
	Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Enterprise Admins"
	```

#### **Common Pitfalls in Privilege Assignments**

- Check for over-privileged accounts.

	```powershell
	# Detect users with unexpected administrative privileges
 
	Get-ADUser -Filter {AdminCount -eq 1} -Properties MemberOf
	```
