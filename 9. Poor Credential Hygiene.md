## 9. **Poor Credential Hygiene**

### **Common Credential Management Errors in Active Directory (AD)**

1. **Weak Password Policies**:
   - **Description**: Users are allowed to set simple, easily guessable passwords.
   - **Examples**: Short passwords, passwords without complexity requirements, and the reuse of previous passwords.

2. **Unchanged Default Credentials**:
   - **Description**: Default usernames and passwords for systems and devices are not changed after initial setup.
   - **Examples**: Admin/admin, root/root on network devices or applications.

3. **Password Sharing**:
   - **Description**: Users share passwords among themselves, leading to a lack of individual accountability.
   - **Examples**: Shared administrative accounts or shared credentials for common services.

4. **Storing Credentials Insecurely**:
   - **Description**: Passwords are stored in plaintext or in insecure locations.
   - **Examples**: Passwords written on sticky notes, saved in unencrypted text files, or stored in unsecured cloud services.

5. **Lack of Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - **Description**: MFA is not implemented, making it easier for attackers to compromise accounts.
   - **Examples**: Relying solely on passwords for authentication, even for high-privilege accounts.

6. **Over-permissive Access Rights**:
   - **Description**: Users are granted more privileges than necessary, increasing the risk of misuse or compromise.
   - **Examples**: Non-administrative users having administrative rights on systems or databases.

### Techniques for Improving Credential Hygiene

1. **Enforce Strong Password Policies**:
   - **Length and Complexity**: Require passwords to be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
   - **Regular Changes**: Mandate periodic password changes and prevent the reuse of previous passwords.
- Search for weak passwords in AD
```powershell
Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties PasswordLastSet | Where-Object { $_.PasswordLastSet -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-90) }
```
- Enforce strong password policies.

```powershell
# Apply strong password policies

Set-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy -MinPasswordLength 14 -ComplexityEnabled $true
```


2. **Implement Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - **Additional Layer**: Require a second form of authentication, such as a mobile app, hardware token, or biometric factor.
   - **Application**: Enforce MFA especially for privileged accounts and remote access.

3. **Regular Credential Audits**:
   - **Review Access**: Periodically review user accounts and access rights to ensure they are still appropriate.
   - **Revoke Unused Accounts**: Disable or delete accounts that are no longer in use, particularly for former employees.
  
- **PowerShell Cmdlets**: Use PowerShell to audit and manage credentials.
```powershell
     # Audit user password expiry
     Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties "msDS-UserPasswordExpiryTimeComputed" | Select-Object Name, @{Name="PasswordExpiryDate";Expression={[datetime]::FromFileTime($_."msDS-UserPasswordExpiryTimeComputed")}}
```
     
4. **Secure Storage of Credentials**:
   - **Password Managers**: Use secure password managers to store and manage credentials.
   - **Encryption**: Ensure that any stored passwords are encrypted and access to them is controlled.

5. **Educate Users on Credential Security**:
   - **Training Programs**: Provide regular training sessions on the importance of credential hygiene and how to maintain it.
   - **Awareness Campaigns**: Run awareness campaigns to highlight the risks of poor credential practices and promote best practices.
- Use tools like LAPS for credential management.
```powershell
# Check LAPS configuration

Get-AdmPwdPassword -ComputerName "TargetComputer"
```
  


6. **Monitor and Respond to Credential Compromise**:
   - **Alerting**: Set up alerts for suspicious login attempts and potential credential compromises.
   - **Incident Response**: Have a robust incident response plan in place for handling credential breaches.

- Find weak or exposed credentials.
