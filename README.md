# Fortifying Active Directory Combatting Misconfigurations

This Git Repo is a companion piece to my talk **Fortifying Active Directory: Combatting Misconfigurations** which delves into the critical issue of common network misconfigurations in large organizations as highlighted by a joint cybersecurity [advisory](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-278a) from the NSA and CISA. Focusing specifically on Microsoft Active Directory (AD), the talk explores the top 10 security vulnerabilities that cyber actors often exploit. Participants gain a understanding of how these misconfigurations work in AD environments and the best practices for mitigating them. This talk is essential for IT professionals and security administrators seeking to enhance their cybersecurity posture against sophisticated threats.
