### 5. **Poor Patch Management**

#### **Impact of Outdated AD Systems and Software**

- **Security Vulnerabilities**:

	- **Exploitation**: Outdated systems and software are susceptible to known vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, elevate privileges, and execute arbitrary code.
	
	- **Malware and Ransomware**: Unpatched systems are prime targets for malware and ransomware attacks, leading to data breaches, system outages, and significant financial losses.

- **Operational Issues**:

	- **System Instability**: Running outdated software can cause system crashes, compatibility issues, and operational disruptions, affecting business continuity.
	
	- **Compliance Risks**: Many regulatory frameworks require timely patching of systems to ensure data security and privacy. Failure to comply can result in legal and financial penalties.

- **Examples of High-Profile Vulnerabilities**:

	- **EternalBlue**: Exploited by the WannaCry ransomware, this vulnerability affected unpatched Windows systems (MS17-010).
	
	- **ZeroLogon**: A critical vulnerability in the Netlogon protocol (CVE-2020-1472) allowed attackers to gain domain admin privileges.




- Identify unpatched systems.

```powershell
# Check for missing patches

Get-WindowsUpdateLog | Select-String "Failed"
```

#### **Automating Updates and Patch Management Processes**

- Verify automated patch management settings.

```powershell
# Ensure WSUS configuration

Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU"
```

#### **Ensuring AD Environment Integrity Through Regular Updates**

- Confirm the installation of critical updates.
  
```powershel
# Validate that critical updates have been installed

Get-WindowsUpdate -Classification Critical
```
