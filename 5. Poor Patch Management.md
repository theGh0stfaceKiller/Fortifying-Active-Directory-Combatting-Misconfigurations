## 5. **Poor Patch Management**

### **Impact of Outdated AD Systems and Software**

- **Security Vulnerabilities**:

	- **Exploitation**: Outdated systems and software are susceptible to known vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, elevate privileges, and execute arbitrary code.
	
	- **Malware and Ransomware**: Unpatched systems are prime targets for malware and ransomware attacks, leading to data breaches, system outages, and significant financial losses.

- **Operational Issues**:

	- **System Instability**: Running outdated software can cause system crashes, compatibility issues, and operational disruptions, affecting business continuity.
	
	- **Compliance Risks**: Many regulatory frameworks require timely patching of systems to ensure data security and privacy. Failure to comply can result in legal and financial penalties.

- **Examples of High-Profile Vulnerabilities**:

	- **EternalBlue**: Exploited by the WannaCry ransomware, this vulnerability affected unpatched Windows systems (MS17-010).
	
	- **ZeroLogon**: A critical vulnerability in the Netlogon protocol (CVE-2020-1472) allowed attackers to gain domain admin privileges.

### Ensuring AD Environment Integrity Through Regular Patch Management Processes and Tools

1. **Patch Management Tools**:

   - **Microsoft Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)**: Centralizes the management and distribution of updates released by Microsoft.

   - **System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM)**: Provides comprehensive management of software updates across large enterprises.

   - **Third-Party Solutions**: Tools like Ivanti Patch for Windows, SolarWinds Patch Manager, and ManageEngine Patch Manager Plus offer additional features and broader platform support.

   ```plaintext
   Example: Using WSUS
   - Configure WSUS Server: Install and configure WSUS to synchronize updates from Microsoft Update.
   - Group Policy: Use Group Policy to configure client systems to receive updates from the WSUS server.
   - Update Approval: Manually or automatically approve updates for deployment.
   ```
   - Verify automated patch management settings.

	```powershell
	# Ensure WSUS configuration
	
	Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU"
	```

2. **Automated Patch Deployment**:

   - **Scheduled Updates**: Define maintenance windows to apply patches during non-business hours to minimize disruptions.

   - **Automated Reboots**: Schedule system reboots post-update to ensure patches are fully applied without manual intervention.

   ```plaintext
   Example: Automating with SCCM
   - Create Update Packages: Group updates into deployment packages.
   - Deployment Schedule: Define deployment schedules and maintenance windows.
   - Compliance Reports: Generate compliance reports to ensure updates are applied successfully.
   ```

   - Confirm the installation of critical updates.
  
	```powershell
	# Validate that critical updates have been installed
	
	Get-WindowsUpdate -Classification Critical
	```

   - Identify unpatched systems.

	```powershell
	# Check for missing patches
	
	Get-WindowsUpdateLog | Select-String "Failed"
	```

3. **Patch Testing and Validation**:

   - **Staging Environment**: Deploy updates in a staging environment before rolling them out to production to identify potential issues.

   - **Rollback Plan**: Have a rollback plan in place to quickly revert changes if an update causes unexpected issues.

   ```plaintext
   Example: Patch Testing Workflow
   - Deploy to Test Group: Apply patches to a small test group of systems.
   - Monitor and Validate: Monitor system performance and validate functionality post-update.
   - Production Deployment: Proceed with broader deployment if no issues are found.
   ```

4. **Monitoring and Reporting**:

   - **Update Compliance Reports**: Regularly generate and review compliance reports to identify systems that are not up-to-date.

   - **Alerting and Notifications**: Set up alerts for failed patch deployments or systems missing critical updates.

   ```powershell
   # Example: Generating a Compliance Report with PowerShell
   Get-WindowsUpdateLog | Out-File -FilePath "C:\UpdateLogs\UpdateComplianceReport.txt"
   ```

5. **Security Baselines and Configuration Management**:

   - **Security Baselines**: Apply security baselines provided by Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit to ensure consistent security configurations.

   - **Configuration Management**: Use Group Policy and other configuration management tools to enforce consistent patch management policies across the AD environment.

   ```plaintext
   Example: Security Baseline Application
   - Download Baselines: Obtain security baselines from the Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit.
   - Import into Group Policy: Import and apply baselines using Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).
   - Monitor Compliance: Use tools like Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit to monitor and report compliance.
   ```
