## 4. **Lack of Network Segmentation**

### **Role of Network Segmentation in Protecting AD**

Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller, distinct segments or subnetworks. Each segment is isolated from the others, typically using firewalls, VLANs, or other network security devices. This isolation helps control and restrict traffic flow between segments.

- **Importance**:

	- **Isolation of Critical Systems**: Protects critical systems such as AD domain controllers (DCs) from less secure parts of the network.
	
	- **Containment of Breaches**: Limits the spread of malware and lateral movement by attackers within the network.
	
	- **Access Control**: Enables granular control over who and what can access specific network segments, enhancing overall security.

### **Strategies for Segmenting AD Controlled Networks**

1. **Tiered Administration Model**:

   - **Tier 0**: Contains highly sensitive systems, including AD domain controllers, AD forest root servers, and critical infrastructure services.

   - **Tier 1**: Contains enterprise servers and applications that do not directly control AD but are critical for business operations.

   - **Tier 2**: Contains user workstations and devices.

   ```plaintext
   Example:
   - Tier 0: Domain Controllers, AD FS Servers
   - Tier 1: SQL Servers, Web Servers
   - Tier 2: User Workstations, Laptops
   ```

2. **Use of VLANs and Subnets**:

   - **VLANs**: Create VLANs for different types of devices (e.g., servers, workstations, printers) and ensure that VLANs for critical systems are isolated from general user VLANs.

   - **Subnets**: Assign different IP subnets to each segment to simplify access control and monitoring.

   ```plaintext
   Example:
   - VLAN 10: Domain Controllers (10.0.0.0/24)
   - VLAN 20: Servers (10.0.1.0/24)
   - VLAN 30: Workstations (10.0.2.0/24)
   ```

3. **Firewalls and Access Control Lists (ACLs)**:

   - **Internal Firewalls**: Deploy internal firewalls between segments to control and inspect traffic between them.

   - **ACLs**: Use ACLs on routers and switches to enforce policies that restrict access based on source, destination, and type of traffic.

   ```plaintext
   Example ACL:
   - Permit traffic from Admin Workstations to Domain Controllers
   - Deny traffic from User Workstations to Domain Controllers
   ```
   - Ensure proper firewall rules.

	```powershell
	# Check Windows Firewall rules related to segmentation
 
	Get-NetFirewallRule -PolicyStore ActiveStore
	```

4. **Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs)**:

   - **Dedicated PAWs**: Use PAWs for administrative tasks and ensure these workstations are on a separate, highly secure network segment.

   ```plaintext
   Example:
   - PAW Network: 10.0.3.0/24 (access restricted to Tier 0 and Tier 1)
   ```

5. **Network Segmentation Tools**:

   - **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)**: Use SDN solutions to dynamically manage and enforce network segmentation policies.

   - **Micro-Segmentation**: Implement micro-segmentation using tools like VMware NSX or Cisco ACI to enforce fine-grained security policies at the application level.


   - Test network segmentation effectiveness.

	```shell
	# Use nmap to verify segmentation
 
	nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
	```
 	- Verify network segmentation.

	```powershell
	# Identify current network segments and their associated AD objects
 
	Get-ADSiteLink -Filter *
	```
