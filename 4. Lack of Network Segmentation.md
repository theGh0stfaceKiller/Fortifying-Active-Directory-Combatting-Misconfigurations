### 4. **Lack of Network Segmentation**

#### **Role of Network Segmentation in Protecting AD**

Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller, distinct segments or subnetworks. Each segment is isolated from the others, typically using firewalls, VLANs, or other network security devices. This isolation helps control and restrict traffic flow between segments.

- **Importance**:

	- **Isolation of Critical Systems**: Protects critical systems such as AD domain controllers (DCs) from less secure parts of the network.
	
	- **Containment of Breaches**: Limits the spread of malware and lateral movement by attackers within the network.
	
	- **Access Control**: Enables granular control over who and what can access specific network segments, enhancing overall security.



- Verify network segmentation.

	```powershell
	# Identify current network segments and their associated AD objects
 
	Get-ADSiteLink -Filter *
	```

#### **Strategies for Segmenting AD Controlled Networks**

- Test network segmentation effectiveness.

	```bash
	# Use nmap to verify segmentation
 
	nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
	```

#### **Benefits in Preventing Lateral Movement**

- Ensure proper firewall rules.

	```powershell
	# Check Windows Firewall rules related to segmentation
 
	Get-NetFirewallRule -PolicyStore ActiveStore
	```
