## 10. **Unrestricted Code Execution**

### **Risks Associated with Unrestricted Code Execution in AD Environments**

1. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - **Description**: Malicious users or attackers can exploit unrestricted code execution to elevate their privileges, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems.
   - **Examples**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in software to execute code with elevated permissions.

2. **Malware and Ransomware**:
   - **Description**: Unrestricted code execution allows the deployment and execution of malware and ransomware, leading to data breaches, data loss, and operational disruptions.
   - **Examples**: Downloading and executing malicious scripts or binaries on AD-connected systems.

3. **Lateral Movement**:
   - **Description**: Attackers can move laterally across the network by executing code on multiple systems, compromising additional accounts and services.
   - **Examples**: Using tools like PsExec to execute commands on remote systems.

4. **Data Exfiltration**:
   - **Description**: Malicious code can be used to exfiltrate sensitive data from the organization, leading to data breaches and loss of intellectual property.
   - **Examples**: Scripts that collect and send data to external servers.

5. **Persistence Mechanisms**:
   - **Description**: Attackers can use unrestricted code execution to establish persistence mechanisms, maintaining long-term access to compromised systems.
   - **Examples**: Installing backdoors or modifying startup scripts.

### Best Practices to Restrict Code Execution

1. **Group Policy Restrictions**:
   - **Description**: Use Group Policy to restrict script and executable execution.
   - **Implementation**: Define and enforce policies that limit where and how code can be executed.


- Ensure policies restrict code execution.
  
   ```powershell
   # Review Group Policy settings for script execution
   
   Get-GPRegistryValue -Name "Default Domain Policy" -Key "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Script" -ValueName "ScriptBlockLogging"
   ```

   ```powershell
     # Restrict PowerShell script execution
     
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
   ```

2. **Application Whitelisting**:
   - **Description**: Only allow the execution of pre-approved applications and scripts.
   - **Implementation**: Use tools like Microsoft AppLocker or Windows Defender Application Control.

- Verify AppLocker policies.

   ```powershell
   # Check AppLocker rules
   
   Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | Select-Object -ExpandProperty RuleCollections
   ```
   
   ```powershell
     # Create AppLocker rules to whitelist applications
     
     New-AppLockerPolicy -Default -UserOrGroupSid "S-1-1-0" -XmlPolicy "C:\AppLockerPolicy.xml"
     
     Import-AppLockerPolicy -XmlPolicy "C:\AppLockerPolicy.xml" -Merge
   ```

3. **User Account Control (UAC)**:
   - **Description**: Enforce UAC to limit the execution of administrative tasks to authorized users.
   - **Implementation**: Configure UAC settings to require user consent or administrator credentials.
- UAC Enablement
```powershell
     # Enable UAC
     
     Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" -Name "EnableLUA" -Value 1
```

4. **Restrict Administrative Access**:
   - **Description**: Limit administrative access to only those users who require it.
   - **Implementation**: Use least privilege principles and regularly review administrative accounts.
  
- Test for unrestricted code execution.
  
```powershell
# Attempt to execute a command as a non-privileged user

Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock { Get-Process } -Credential "LowPrivUser"
```

5. **Security Hardening**:
   - **Description**: Apply security hardening guidelines to reduce the attack surface.
   - **Implementation**: Follow best practices for securing operating systems and applications.
