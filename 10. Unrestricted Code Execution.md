### 10. **Unrestricted Code Execution**

#### **Risks Associated with Unrestricted Code Execution in AD Environments**

- Test for unrestricted code execution.
  
```powershell
# Attempt to execute a command as a non-privileged user

Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock { Get-Process } -Credential "LowPrivUser"
```

#### **Best Practices to Restrict Code Execution**

- Ensure policies restrict code execution.
  
```powershell
# Review Group Policy settings for script execution

Get-GPRegistryValue -Name "Default Domain Policy" -Key "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Script" -ValueName "ScriptBlockLogging"
```

#### **Implementing Application Whitelisting and Sandboxing Techniques**

- Verify AppLocker policies.

```powershell
# Check AppLocker rules

Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | Select-Object -ExpandProperty RuleCollections
```
